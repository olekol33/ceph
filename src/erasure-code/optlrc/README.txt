Optimal-LRC
-----------------------
Optimal-LRC is a recently proposed [1] full-LRC . In this code, k data blocks and m global parities are divided into groups of size r, 
and a local parity is added to each group, allowing repair of any lost block by the r surviving blocks in its group. 
r does not necessarily divide m + k, but Optimal-LRC requires that n mod (r + 1) != 1.
